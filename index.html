            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Abstract: This report details the development
and implementation of Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and non-neural network
models (NNNs) to classify clothing articles using
the famous FashionMNIST dataset and
determine the optimal approach for classifying
this dataset. The experiment explored Multilayer
Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machines
(SVM) , Random Forest(RF), K-Nearest
Neighbors(kNN), Gradient Boosting
Machines(GBM) and two Convolution Neural
Network(CNN) machine learning modes to
classify the images into distinct clothing
categories. The two CNN models, 4Convolutional

Layers, 4Fully Connected Layers (4XConv-
layers 4XfC-layers(CNN-1) and 5Convolutional

Layers, 5Fully Connected Layers (5XConv-
layers 5XfC-layers(CNN-2) were evaluated to

improve the classification.
CNN-2 was selected as the best model for
FashionMNIST dataset classification since it
outperformed all the other models in all areas of
metrics evaluation, showing an overall accuracy
of 91.5% on the testing dataset. Recall, F1-score,
and computational efficiency were metrics
utilized to evaluate the performance to select this
optimal algorithm. Even though its architecture
may offer a better and a more detailed feature
extraction, it also risked overfitting due to its
complexity as compared to CNN-1, which was
observed during model evaluations.
Additionally, although CNN2 seemed to have a
more complex architecture with additional
layers, the performance improvement from
CNN-1, which had an overall accuracy of around
90.9% on the test, to CNN-2 wasn't substantial.

GBM models also demonstrated competitive
performance, achieving accuracy levels
around 85% to 89% on the FashionMNIST
dataset. While not as high performing as CNNs,
other NNNs showed good precision and recall
across different classes. The results of the
confusion matrices highlighted some deviations
in classification, especially for several models in
the Shirts category, indicating that accurate
classification of this clothing type</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>FashionMNIST, a dataset comprising 70,000 grayscale images across 10 classes, presents a comprehensive challenge for machine learning models due to its complex nature and the resemblance between different categories. The study emphasizes the importance of clothing item classification in computer vision and its practical applications, such as in inventory management.</p>

            <h2>Data Preparation, Transformation, and EDA</h2>
            <p>The FashionMNIST dataset underwent several preparation and transformation steps to make it suitable for the classification models. This process involved normalization, scaling, and augmentation techniques to enhance the dataset's diversity and representativeness. Additionally, exploratory data analysis was conducted to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics, such as Principal Component Analysis</p>

            <h2>Methods/Experiments</h2>
            <p>The methodology includes model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation. Models were assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Two CNN architectures, CNN-1 (4 convolutional layers, 4 fully connected layers) and CNN-2 (5 convolutional layers, 5 fully connected layers), were the focus due to their advanced feature extraction capabilities. The training process was conducted using the PyTorch library, with emphasis on data transformation, dataset splitting, and efficient data loading techniques.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The study concluded that CNNs outperform NNNs in classifying the FashionMNIST dataset. While both CNN models achieved high accuracy, CNN-2 showed a marginal improvement over CNN-1, indicating that a more complex architecture might lead to better feature extraction but also poses the risk of overfitting.</p>
